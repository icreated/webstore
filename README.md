## Installing / Getting started

Run `npm install`.

This will create the node_modules directory in your current directory (if one doesnâ€™t exist yet) and will download packages to that directory.

Install also backend API REST services. There are two options:
* Simple Json Server: [https://github.com/icreated/webstore-json-server](https://github.com/icreated/webstore-json-server) available at port 3000
* Idempiere Webstore API REST plugin: [https://github.com/icreated/webstore-api](https://github.com/icreated/webstore-api) In this case you have to:
  * Install Postgresql
  * Install Idempiere
  * Install Webstore API REST plugin
  * Configure all these components

The backend endpoint is configured in the environment.ts file:
```
    api: {
      baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000' // for Json Server
      // baseUrl: 'http://localhost:8080/services/api/', // for Idempiere Webstore API REST plugin
    }
```



### Deploying / Publishing / Testing

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
